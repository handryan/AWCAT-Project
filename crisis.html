            <p tabindex="0">
                We are now in a global crisis. The crisis is just beginning, although the causes of the crisis have been building up for decades. At first, the changes were almost imperceptible. Recently, more dramatic changes have been noted. Melting of galciers, ice caps, land ice. Rapidly rising ocean temperatures. Rising sea levels. Extreme weather events. Drought.<br>
              

               <br> These phenomenon are not just signs
                of climate change. They are the signs of a crisis. Because climate change has led us to a global crisis, that goes well beyond climate change, into every aspect of human life on Earth.<br>

                <br>Our global crisis is not just environmental. It is economic, because the world economy is going to be affected by it. lt is social, because billions of people will be affected by it. It is political, because to solve the crisis, nations are going to have to compromise on an agreement to limit emissions at a time when the global geopolitical situation seems to be getting worse every day, driving nations apart when they should be coming together to work to solve climate change.
